A stripped-down version of [pysondb](https://github.com/fredysomy/pysonDB) by [Fredy Somy](https://github.com/fredysomy).

---

## üéâ Features.

- No third party packages needed
- No CLI
- No ImageUtils
- Use of [python naming conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names) in functions and classes.
- Just the code required to perform CRUD operation on JSON DB.
- Users can generate custom id's for their data.
- DB clustering (User can access / modify multiple DB from a single point / class)

## ‚úèÔ∏èÔ∏è Note

Even though it's called a stripped-down version, there are some huge differences in the way this package works.

- The data is not saved to file instantly, instead a methods needs to be called in order to do that.
- The user is supposed to pass the keys / column name for the DB during initialization of the `DB` class.
- Some of the new methods that are not derived from PysonDB are,
  - [`pop`](https://github.com/Adwaith-Rajesh/strip.pysondb/blob/master/docs/docs.md#dbpop_id-str---dictstr-any--none)
  - [`commit`](https://github.com/Adwaith-Rajesh/strip.pysondb/blob/master/docs/docs.md#saving-to-a-file)
  - [`load`](https://github.com/Adwaith-Rajesh/strip.pysondb/blob/master/docs/docs.md#load-values-from-a-file)
  - [`values`](https://github.com/Adwaith-Rajesh/strip.pysondb/blob/master/docs/docs.md#get-the-first-n-values-from-the-db)
  - [`set_id_generator`](https://github.com/Adwaith-Rajesh/strip.pysondb/blob/master/docs/docs.md#using-a-custom-id-generator)
  - [`id_exists`](https://github.com/Adwaith-Rajesh/strip.pysondb/blob/master/docs/docs.md#check-whether-an-id-exists-in-the-db)
